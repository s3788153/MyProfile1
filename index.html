<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Phillip Pham</h1>
	<br>
<h2>Personal Information </h2>
<p> My name is Phillip Pham and I was born in Australia; however, my parents were from Vietnam therefore I am fluent in both English and Vietnamese. My student ID is s3788153 and my student email address is s3788153@student.rmit.edu.au. It is my first year studying at RMIT under the course of Information Technology however I have previously studied at a different institution and before that have completed my VCE studies in Melbourne. I have a wide range of different interest and hobbies, from arts and craft, gaming, cars, reading, music, computer parts and most recently speed cubing. An interesting fact about a hobby would be that my fastest Rubik’s cube solve was 22 seconds. </p>

	<h3> Interest in IT </h3>
<p> My interest in information and technology stems from the fact that I was introduced to games at a very young age along with the fact that a close relative of mine was a working IT technician, therefore I grew up with an adequate knowledge of how the hardware works. The main spark was in high school where I was interested in building my own pc therefore I had all the research on parts which lead to an appreciation to IT. From there my interest expanded and I became more interested in learning about technology. 
  I have previously studied Science at Monash University Clayton, one of the main reasons why I choose to study at RMIT instead of Monash for Information Technology was because RMIT focused more on a hands-on approach to learning as opposed to learning the theory before gaining experience. This also applied to a lot of other Universities as well, as the curriculum was more focused around theory, which I would prefer to learn by actual hands on work and not through reading textbooks. 
  Through my studies I would expect to become adequate in coding and program and well versed about backend programming as it is much current interest. With the skills acquired I would like to be able to find a job relating to coding and programming or even backend design or at least somewhere within the field of IT as I believe it is the occupation of the future. </p>

<h4> Ideal Job </h4>

<p> The company Tinybeans is advertising for a position within the development department. The job would involve creating new implementation and coming up with new improvements to the app. This position appeals to me because it is a mixture of both aspects of programing and design. With developing new ideas and updates for the app, while also improving user experience with newly designed user interface. The company boast a flexible working hour and even a work from home policy. However, the biggest appeal would be the fact that the company has two major teams located in New York and Sydney which means possible travelling to a different state or country which would be rewarding not only in the self-development department but also being able to work in a whole new environment sounds extremely promising.
  As the company is looking to hire a programmer/developer, the position would require one to have a wide range of skills and knowledge in all the programming languages with mainly skills in the iOS application side of the programming as well as being able to use specific applications such as Storyboards, Auto Layout, UIKit, Multi-threading, CoreData, Swift, Objective-C and Apple XC Test framework as noted by the company. Since the application also notes in testing the interface and user experience, knowledge with User-Centered Design is also very important.
  At the very moment I only have a brief understanding in the programming language of Java and slight knowledge of User-Centered Design, however through my studies at RMIT to become well versed in the desired application as well as the knowledge behind backend programming and designs. As well as self-directed learning on other programming languages such as C++, Python etc, to become more familiar to the work environment that is required. </p>

<h6>Results </h6>
<P>The first test was the Myers-Briggs test which indicated that I was a ‘Mediator’ INFP-T. The overall results to me was quite accurate as I do believe that I am quite introverted and base a lot of decisions irrationally and usually due to my emotions, however a lot of this is kept hidden as I prefer a stoic and professional look on the outside as opposed to letting my emotions getting in the way of the work field.  The second test was the learning style’s test, which indicates that I was more of visual learner as opposed to auditory and tactile learning. The Big 5 personality test analyses 5 major factors of personality. Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. The results of the first factor, Openness, having a high Openness level indicates a more creative, imaginative and artistic personality. The second was Conscientiousness, which my results indicates that I am more orderly, dependable, dutiful and ambitious. The third factor was Extraversion which shows that I am more reserved, calm and introspective. The fourth factor was Agreeableness, my score was in the middle indicating that I can be competitive at times however still accommodating and helpful when it comes to team work and finally the last factor which was Neuroticism which my test shows that I was more on the emotional side as well as being self-conscious of not only my surroundings but also myself. All the tests indicate that I would be able to function well in a team as I would prefer to show a more professional side of myself as oppose to having my emotions take over control. The Big Five personality test and the Myers-Briggs test shows that I am willing to listen while also being able to take charge if needed in a group, indicating that I am flexible to work in any team if the team can keep up to my competitive nature found in the Agreeableness factor. When putting all these factors together, when forming a team, if the members are motivated in getting the work done with the highest possible quality, I can fit in with any type of group, due to my easy going and understanding personality.</P>

<h7> <b>Project: The Card-less Future</b> </h7>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h8>Overview </h8>
<p> For the past couple of years, one of the buzz words that has been thrown around was Cryptocurrency, an online currency that has value in the real world, recently Apple has announced the Apple Card, a physical card for all types of currency from all types of banks to be integrated into their apple pay system. Everything is slowly becoming digitalised from the way we are able to purchase products with the touch of our phone or smart watch, to a few types of identification factors such as the health care card being integrated into the Centrelink app, what if we were able to step outside one day and not have to worry about bringing our wallet as our credit card, student id, driver’s license, gym membership, mkyi were on an app where all we need is our phone in order to access those items, a card-less future. </p>
<br>
<img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/social/ios12-iphone-x-use-wallet-social-card.jpg"> <br>
<br>
<h9>Motivation </h9>
<p>According to the Statista, the expected number of smart phone owners are roughly around 2.7 billion people, with an expected number of mobile phone users to surpass 5 billion by 2019. This is more than half the current population of the world. An average person leaving their house to travel into the CBD would on average bring along in their wallet; money, credit card, any sort of identification and a concession card, imagine a future where one day all they would need to bring their mobile phone as all these miscellaneous items would all be integrated into an app. Not only would we be saving money on printing the cards, but the removing the hassle of adding carrying around a wallet which would increase the chances of it being lost or stolen, where if the only thing you had to worry about was just your phone and your keys. </p>

<br>
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/">statista</a> <br>
<br>
<h10>Description </h10>
<p>The Application would ideally start out on both iOS and android devices but will slowly make its way towards every possible mobile device. The application would aim to replace all the cards we use now, from identification, credit cards and membership cards with the purpose to transferring all these physical cards onto our mobile devices. The application would be similar to the current Wallet app found on iOS, where the user is required to manually enter the information required for the card or quite simply taking a photo of it, this will then add the desired card onto the device. While currently Apple’s app only works on credit cards, movie tickets and coupons, this application will take the idea further with the addition of all possible cards. Specific Cards would also have special functions built within the application. For example the driver’s license, at the moment if you were to change your address, you would have to log onto Vic Roads, change to your new address and wait 2 weeks for them to send you a sticker so that you can stick onto the back of your driver’s licence, with this app, you can change you address on the fly without having to resort to sticking a small piece of paper on the back of the physical card. Another card specific feature would be the Mkyi card, imagine if you were able to top up your myki card on the fly through the app, instead of using the outdated top up machines which works about half the time. </p>
<h11>Tools and Technology </h11>
<p>As this is mainly a phone application, using software which is designed for uses on mobile phones would be ideal. Software required would be those in which would allow for coding specifically for mobile phones, ideally for both iOS and Android as the application is looking to be used cross platform. Creative Apps would also be required in design how the application itself would look and run, as user experience is also a major factor in this, as the application needs to be able to store a wide range of different cards. Software such as .NET to build cross-platform applications and JavaScript for developing the application, using Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Illustrator for the design of the application and additional software’s such as Swift, CoreData and Apple XC test and SQL to assist in programming the application. </p>
<h12> Skills Required </h12>
<p> As stated above for the required applications and software, having knowledge of all the programming language would be very helpful, as some application would require coding in Java while others would require C++, also skills in using the Adobe programs would be required. Knowledge on user experience would also be very helpful, as no matter how useful the application is, if the user cannot figure out how to use it, it will ultimately be useless, therefore knowledge of user experience to create a good user interface would be required. Most of the applications required are either free on the internet or provided by the university itself, however the skills required is not quite feasible. As the application will be handling important information of the user, a professional level of skills is required for the software development to minimise possible bugs that could ultimately leak user info or put the user’s data at risk. </p>
<h13>Outcome </h13>
<p>If the project becomes successful, we are one step closer to a digital future, as the woes of carrying credit cards, money, identification and train tickets can all be voided as all we need is our mobile phone to complete all those tasks. From purchasing items, to tapping on and off to needing to show your identification all being done from one device. The convince of being able to update your personal details and having it update immediately, not having to deal with expired credit cards and concession cards, topping up your myki card and paying for everything with your phone and not have to deal with loose change or carry large amounts of money. With the implementation of this application we are one step close to a fully digitised future. </p>
