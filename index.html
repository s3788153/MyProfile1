<h1>Phillip Pham</h1>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p> My name is Phillip Pham and I was born in Australia; however, my parents were from Vietnam therefore I am fluent in both English and Vietnamese. My student ID is s3788153 and my student email address is s3788153@student.rmit.edu.au. It is my first year studying at RMIT under the course of Information Technology however I have previously studied at a different institution and before that have completed my VCE studies in Melbourne. I have a wide range of different interest and hobbies, from arts and craft, gaming, cars, reading, music, computer parts and most recently speed cubing. An interesting fact about a hobby would be that my fastest Rubikâ€™s cube solve was 22 seconds. </p>
